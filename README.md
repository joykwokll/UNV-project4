# UNV AESTHETICS 

## Project Brief
### Technical Requirements

- Use MongoDB, Express, React and Node (MERN Stack)
- Have at least 2 related models (with references) and an additional user model with authentication. There should be at least 2 types of users.
- Include all major CRUD functions for at least one of the models
- Nicely styled front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with or without a framework.
- Deploy your application online, so that it is publically accessible
- User stories that apply to the functionality of your app, crafted as a team.

### Final Deliverables
- Deployed on Heroku: https://unv-project4.herokuapp.com/


##  Description

UNV Aesthetics Salon is a well established beauty and wellness brand that is in the market for almost 19 years. It provides first class treatments and have won numerous awards over the years. Their original website does not include an appointment feature and this is where my inspiration and idea came from. 

### Technologies Used
- React: CRA (Front-end)
- Express (Back-end)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Postman (Database)
- Figma (Fireframing)
- Github & Github Desktop
- Heroku (Deployment)
- Bootstrap (CSS)


### General Approach

I started off with wireframing and I have crafted a sheet of sample data to understand the features that are needed for a website like this. I have also plotted an User Story to understand the flow of how this website will behave. As well as picturing an experience of how the user will feel when using this improved website. 


### Installation Instructions
- Clone or download the repo
- `npm install`


###  User Stories

Who are your users? : Existing Customers as well as new potential customers who may have came across our website and are keen to learn more about our services. \
&nbsp;  
What do they want? : To be able to learn more about our services, gained beauty tips during their stay, make appointment conveniently with our website as well as have a record with us. \
&nbsp;  
Why? : Currently, UNV salon is still using manual methods to make facial appointments. They are writing down every appointments made on a book. A few days prioir to the appointment, staff will have to phone the customers to remind and confirm the appointment. As technology advances, I thought that it is time to bring this feature online as it is more convenient and time saving.

## Planning and Development Process


**Week 1**

1. Create new Github Repository for both front end and back end. 

2. Create a wireframe using figma to draft out the visuals of the website. Wireframes bring clarity to your projects, allowing you to work through all the interactions and layout needs.

3. Set up the project files and installed the necessary dependencies\
  
   - Front-end: CRA - npx create-react-app
  
   - Back-end: Express - npm i express

4. Create sample data after brainstorming what is needed for the website. 

5. Front-end: Do up all the necessary routes and create needed components and link them up. Import font from google fonts. Create all the routes needed. Do up the Navigation Bar.

6. Test deploy to Heroku after linking. 

**Week 2**

1. Create a MongoDB database and link the database through both local and cloud. Link MongoDB to back-end.

3. Back-end: Create important models & schemas according to sample data did previously. Done up User and Appointment schemas.

4. Back-end: Create User and Appointment controllers and link it to the schemas.

5. Front-end: Get CSS from react bootstrap, apply it to all the routes. Adjust accordingly, the forms/buttons/row/card.

6. Input content accordingly to each route. Make sure that all the CSS are in place. 

**Week 3**

1. Front-end: 

7. Complete this read-me page.



### Major Hurdles

One main hurdle is the reset password part. It is much more complicated than I expected. There are multiple unexpected errors and crashes.
